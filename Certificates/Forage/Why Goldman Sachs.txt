“Why are you interested in this role?”

I recently participated in Goldman Sachs' job simulation on the Forage platform,
and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to be part of
an Operations team at Goldman Sachs. I worked on a project to streamline asset
transfers and resolve trade settlement issues for high net worth clients. I
developed my data analysis, problem-solving, and risk-management skills in a
real-world context. Doing this program confirmed that I really enjoy working on
operational challenges in financial services, and I'm excited to apply these
skills to an Operations team at a company like Goldman Sachs.
